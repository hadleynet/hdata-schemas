Maven project to bundle necessary schema and DTD files for java-hstore project.

ISSUE: you will need to edit or remove the setProxy line in pom.xml to suit
the build environment. The Maven Antrun plugin doesn't pass any HTTP proxy
information to the Ant tasks and the standard means of setting a proxy for Ant
also don't work for tasks executed by the Antrun plugin.
